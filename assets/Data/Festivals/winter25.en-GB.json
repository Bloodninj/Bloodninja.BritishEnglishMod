They aren't easy to come by these days!$h#$e#I usually use Fern Island Ringfruit for my premier canes, you know. You can't beat that bright red colouring... And it's all natural!#$e#Oh, you want to know the secret to my deluxe double-canes? Okay, but you've got to promise absolute secrecy. *whisper* It's a drop of vanilla in the white candy to complement the cherry flavour.$h#$e#Of course, peppermint candy canes are the standard, and I always make a healthy batch of those as well.#$e#Hey, you look like you're falling asleep. Are you okay?$s"
