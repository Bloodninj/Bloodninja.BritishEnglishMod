# British English Mod
#### British English localisation for Stardew Valley

This is a mod which changes various bits of text in the base game using Content Patcher, to better match the spelling of English as used in the United Kingdom. Various other small bits have been changed that aren't strictly matters of spelling:

* References to the "movies" now mostly refer to the cinema instead (with the exception of Evelyn, who is old enough to remember when it was still called the pictures)
