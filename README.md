# British English Mod
#### British English localisation for Stardew Valley

This is a mod which changes various bits of text in the base game using Content Patcher, to better match the spelling of English as used in the United Kingdom.

Main changes:

* All spelling conforms to British English as used in the Oxford Dictionary of English
    * For example, "color" becomes "colour", "jewelry" becomes "jewellery", and so on
* Some words have been split and hyphenated ("dyeable" becomes "dye-able")
* The "Dwarven" artefacts have become "Dwarfish" instead
* Some items of clothing have changed
    * "Pants" have become "trousers" (apologies to those in Lancashire who say "pants" anyway)
    * "Letterman Jacket" has become "Baseball Jacket" because nobody remotely cares about baseball here
    * "Sweaters" have returned to their rightful name of "jumpers"

Various other small bits have been changed that aren't strictly matters of spelling:

* References to the "movies" now mostly refer to the cinema instead (with the exception of Evelyn, who is old enough to remember when it was still called the pictures)
* Pierre's General Store can be renamed via the Generic Mod Config Menu if you have it installed (or by manually editing the `config.json` file in the mod directory)
    * While "store" is sometimes used in the UK, "shop" is the more natural word in most cases, especially for a smaller shop
    * Several options are available as presets in the mod config menuG
