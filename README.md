# British English Mod
#### British English localisation for Stardew Valley 1.6

This is a mod which changes various bits of text in the base game using Content Patcher, to better match the spelling of English as used in the United Kingdom.

## Requirements

* [SMAPI](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400)
* [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
* (optional, but recommended) [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098)

## Main changes

* All spelling conforms to British English as used in the Oxford Dictionary of English
    * For example, "color" becomes "colour", "jewelry" becomes "jewellery", and so on
* Some words have been split or hyphenated
* The "Dwarven" artefacts have become "Dwarfish" instead
* "Trash" and "trash cans" have been renamed to "rubbish" and "bins" respectively
  * The purchasable "Copper/Silver/Gold/Iridium Trash Can" from Clint is called "Recycle Bin", since it allows you to recycle the items into money
* Some items of clothing have changed
    * "Pants" have become "trousers" (apologies to those in Lancashire who say "pants" anyway)
    * "Sweaters" have returned to their rightful name of "jumpers"

Various other small bits have been changed that aren't strictly matters of spelling:

* The game clock is now 24-hour (e.g. `18:00`) as opposed to 12-hour (`6:00pm`) - this is configurable via GMCM
* References to the "movies" (the place) now mostly refer to the cinema instead (with the exception of Evelyn, who is old enough to remember when it was still called the pictures)
    * Most references to "movies" as the motion pictures themselves are called "films" now
* Pierre's General Store can be renamed via the [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) if you have it installed (or by manually editing the `config.json` file in the mod directory). Defaults to the regular name.
    * Several options are available as presets in the mod config menu
* If you have the Generic Mod Config Menu, you can also change the title used to refer to your Grandpa
    * Presets are available to choose from, like "Grandad" or "Grandfather"
* "Moms" have been corrected to "mums"

## Not changed

* Alex is still obsessed with American football, which makes it hard to change some things in his dialogue
